###Free writing before getting started

    "Free writing" means that writing freely about whatever comes into your mind for a specific time period, and writing as much as you can in the time you have.
   
 
###Getting started

    1.  Your purpose --Knowing the reason why you're writing.

    2.  Focused free writing --You should write something that relate to one idea.

    3.  The reader --Knowing who you're writing to, just like you're talking with someone.

    4.  Your topic --Confirming what you're writing about.

    5.  Coming up with ideas --List in the paper.

        *  What aspects of the topic are important?

        *  When did I get interested in the topic?

        *  Who is involved?

        *  How can I describe the topic?

        *  In what instance does the topic have most important for other people?

        *  Why is the topic interesting to other people?

    6.  Analyzing the ideas --Classifying the general ideas and the specific ideas.

    7.  Writing an opinion sentence --Writing the opinion and containing the general ideas you're going to write about.

        The easiest thing to do is to write the opinion and then write because. After because, write your general ideas.

    8.  Developing your outline.

            First general idea

                a. specific idea
                b. specific idea
                c. specific idea
        
            Second general idea

                a. specific idea
                b. specific idea
                c. specific idea        

            Third general idea
