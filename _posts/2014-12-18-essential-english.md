#Free writing before getting started

    1.  "Free writing" means that writing freely about whatever comes into your mind for a specific time period, and writing as much as you can in the time you have.
    
    2.  Your purpose --Knowing the reason why you're writing.

    3.  Focused free writing --You should write something that relate to one idea.

    4.  The reader --Knowing who you're writing to, just like you're talking with someone.

    5.  Your topic --Confirming what you're writing about.

    #6.  Coming up with ideas

        1.  What aspects of the topic are important?

        2.  When did I get interested in the topic?

        3.  Who is involved?

        4.  How can I describe the topic?

        5.  In what instance does the topic have most important for other people?

        6.  Why is the topic interesting to other people?
