这两天在看<Essential English>，此书是为了解决英语写作中的常见问题，在此就记录一些我的学习心得。

###Free writing before getting started

    1.  "Free writing" means that writing freely about whatever comes into your mind for a specific time period, and writing as much as you can in the time you have.
    
    2.  Your purpose --Knowing the reason why you're writing.

    3.  Focused free writing --You should write something that relate to one idea.

    4.  The reader --Knowing who you're writing to, just like you're talking with someone.

    5.  Your topic --Confirming what you're writing about.

    6.  Coming up with ideas

        *  What aspects of the topic are important?

        *  When did I get interested in the topic?

        *  Who is involved?

        *  How can I describe the topic?

        *  In what instance does the topic have most important for other people?

        *  Why is the topic interesting to other people?
